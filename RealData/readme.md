## Census data on race in Santa Clara County 
A CSV of racial demographics in the state of California by county (focusing on Santa Clara county to match the scale of the geoJSON file, but I think I'm still
deciding on what the scale of the project should be). Other demographics data from the US Census would be useful too (income, housing/occupancy status, income)
