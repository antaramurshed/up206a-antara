# up206a-antara

## Introduction 
My name is Antara and my pronouns are she/her. 
I am a second year MURP student focusing on transportation and environmental planning and I hope to become proficient with using python for geospatial analysis.  

## Learning Objectives for UP206A
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

Specifically, students will learn to:

Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

## (Current) Project Idea
Comparing past and current Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) spatial data with demographic data (race, ethnicity, income, housing status) at the county level in the State of California to understand which groups are most likely to be affected by wildfires in the past, present, and future.
